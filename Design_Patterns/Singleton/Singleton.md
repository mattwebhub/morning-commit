## Singleton Pattern 
The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## When to Use

- Use the Singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients.

- You need a more controlled access mechanism rather than direct instantiation of a single object.
