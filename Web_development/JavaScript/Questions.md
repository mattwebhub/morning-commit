1- Question: Can you explain how JavaScript's closure works and how it can be effectively used in the context of asynchronous programming?

Explanation: While this might seem like a basic question about closures, it actually requires an understanding of asynchronous programming, which is a more advanced concept in JavaScript.
2- Question: How does JavaScript's event loop work? Can you provide an example where understanding this concept would be crucial in solving a programming issue?

Explanation: The event loop is fundamental to JavaScript, but many developers don't fully understand it. This question asks not only for a theoretical understanding but also for a practical application.
3- Question: Can you explain the concept of "hoisting" in JavaScript and how it affects the order of execution in the code?

Explanation: Hoisting is a fundamental concept in JavaScript, but its implications are often misunderstood. This question explores the examinee's depth of understanding of the execution context.
4- Question: In JavaScript, what does it mean that "null" is a primitive type, but typeof null returns "object"? How does this peculiarity impact the way you write code?

Explanation: This question tests the candidate's understanding of JavaScript's somewhat idiosyncratic type system, including its quirks and how to navigate them.
5- Question: How does the 'this' keyword work in JavaScript? Can you provide examples in different contexts (e.g., global scope, object method, simple function call, Event Handlers)?




Explanation: The 'this' keyword in JavaScript is often misunderstood and can behave differently in different contexts. This question explores how deeply the examinee understands these differences.

6- Question: Can you discuss JavaScript's prototypal inheritance and how it differs from classical inheritance? What are some patterns to effectively use prototypal inheritance?

Explanation: Understanding how JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance works is crucial to effectively write and understand JavaScript code. This question goes beyond the basics and tests the examinee's understanding of practical usage of prototypal inheritance.
